This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

.cache saves a copy of the server content lazily. Just delete it (or the specific file in it) when you need to update content.
